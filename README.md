# Formative Assignment: Advanced Linear Algebra (PCA)

**📌 Overview**

This repository contains my implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch as part of the Advanced Linear Algebra formative assignment.
The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much variance (information) as possible, using eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and covariance concepts.

**📊 Dataset**

Name: Africa Malaria Dataset
Source: Humanitarian health data focusing on malaria prevalence and health indicators across African regions

**📈 Results**

PCA reduced the dataset from N features to M principal components.
The first few components captured the majority of variance.
Visualization shows clusters preserved but rotated into a lower-dimensional space.
Scree plot demonstrates how explained variance guides component selection.
